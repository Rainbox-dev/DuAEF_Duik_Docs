The ***Effector*** is a way to control properties depending on a spatial effector.

## Setup

Like the [*Connector*](connector.md), the *Effector* needs keyframes on the controlled property to work.

1. Animate the slave property
2. Select the property and click on the *Effector* button.
3. You can adjust the behaviour of the *Effector* in its effects.

You can also connect a new property to an existing *Effector*: before clicking on the button, select the property AND the *Effector* you want to connect.

## Effect

In the effect of the *Effector*, you can change the limits, and choose between two modes: circle and infinite line.
Note that in the infinite line mode, the outter limit is ignored.
