# ![list Icon](img\duik-icons\automation\list-icon-r.png) List

The ***List*** is a simple tool to combine different animations and expressions in the same property.

To create a list, select the property and click on the *List* button.

If an expression was already assigned to the property, it is automatically copied into the first slot of the list, along with the existing keyframes.

The *List* is added in the layer effects. You can combine up to five animations and expressions.

!!! note
    The result of the mix is calculated in the following way:  
    `value1 * weight1 + value2 * weight2 + value3 * weight3 + value4 * weight4 + value5 * weight5`
