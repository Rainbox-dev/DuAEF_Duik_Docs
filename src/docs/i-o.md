> After Effects might not be the only software you use in your animation pipeline. Duik comes with some **tools to help you import and export assets** to and from other softwares.  like** Krita, TVPaint, or Audition**â€¦ Duik is also able to export animations (and the rigs, soon) to an open JSON format so that with just a bit of development you can use them in any other software or game engine.

*There is a great variety of things you can do with these interchange tools, and this list is constantly evolving with the creation of new pipelines and third-party softwares.*
