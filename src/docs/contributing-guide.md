# Contributing guide

Don't be afraid to contribute and to make mistakes, you won't break anything nor lead to the end of the world. Any help is appreciated, even the smallest one.

Duik is free and lives only thanks to the contributions. There is always some documentation to write, some stuff to translate in your own language, some bugs to report, some code to writeâ€¦

**First of all, be sure to join us on our live chat on [Discord](http://chat.rainboxlab.org), or on our [forum](http://forum.rainboxlab.org/). We will be very happy to help you get started!**
